# Canvas-Bot
A Discord Bot that allows users to draw on a local canvas. Unsupported since 05/2021.<br>
The main consept of this project was creating a workaround for Discord bots, as Discord blocked bots from using its live video sharing system.<br>
This workaround was later used in Searchable Bot, which was abondoned in late 2021.<br>
This was created for users to have one user stream the window, and others to have control and involvement in the project.<br>

## Instalation
### Packing the code yourself
- Download the code
- Do `npm install` in the main folder
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the lines which are required. (Optionals can be left untouched)
- To run the bot, use `npm start` in the main folder
- To run the canvas, create another console window and use `npm run electron` in the main folder

There are some issues in this code, like Discord throwing major errors which result in crashing the bot, but I'll get back to fixing those when I have time.
